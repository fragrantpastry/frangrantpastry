♡ | Dislikes: I honestly dislike people with no boundaries when it comes to meeting just me for a short amound of time, when it comes to get used to me,
please know your limits, I also dont like stuffs that makes me uncomfortable, im okay with those pictures since its obvious most people do enjoy those arts but with the roleplay,
Im okay with it but i would like roleplay if i feel like it. Im a picky eater, so i dont like most foods that other people likes (ex: matcha) 

Still adding more info about my dislikes, but this is it for now!! ^
